Here are some of the projects that I'm currently working on. I'm always looking for collaborators on new and current projects. Feel free to reach out if you want to work together on something.

### [Final Fantasy (in)Complete](/ffc/)
When I changed the format of my live stream to focus on RPGs, I thought I'd revisit some classics. The first challenge was to beat the first ten mainline Final Fantasy. When I announced this, someone in my audience asked if I was going to 100% finish each game, to which my answer was a resounding "No." Since starting this project, the scope has expanded to complete the entire run of mainline (non-MMO) games.

<!-- ### [Final Battle](/final_battle/)
A gunslinger, a psychic elf, a pyromancer high schooler, and a space baker walk into a pub. Their goal is to get the latest gossip and earn some money: this is Final Battle. A universal system to allow characters from different universes to come together. Final Battle is by far my largest RPG project. -->

### [Backlog Report](/backlog/)
I own more than a few games, many of which are part of en extensive Steam collection. I use [The Backloggery](https://backloggery.com/) so organize that collection. And while I do stream quite a bit, I doubt I will be playing absolutely everything I own on stream. So while I get through my backlog of games offline, I plan on writing in-depth reviews for those games. I will conquer of the minions of Bak'laag!
