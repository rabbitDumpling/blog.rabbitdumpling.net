### [Final Fantasy (in)Complete](/ffc/)
After rediscovering a fondness for RPGs I had forgotten, I have challenged myself to play and beat the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games. When a member of my audience jokingly asked if I was going to 100% finish them, I clarified these were going to be technically completeâ€”(in)Complete as it were.

### [Final Battle](/final_battle/)
My oldest and most detailed RPG project, Final Battle is a universal RPG system whose goal isn't to just let people play whatever setting or genre they want, but also combine them and se the interesting behavior of mixing together different styles of game easily. It is meant to allow tales of space faring explorer to go on an adventure along side magical cowboys and high-fantasy elf.
