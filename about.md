## Author

My name is Sabrael D. Carroll (she/her), probably better known as rabbitDumpling, the internet's favorite bunny girl. I am a queer content creator—writing RPGs, recording podcasts, and streaming video games. My current projects include an RPG system titled *Final Battle* as well as launching a new podcast network called *Dead Moon Live*. When I'm not working on those, I am usually streaming! That's right, I am also a Twitch Affiliate and can often be found streaming long-form RPGs and giving every character as silly of a voice as possible.

## Colophon

This blog was written using [Visual Studio Code][vscode], and is compiled with the help of [jekyll][jekyll-org]. The layout is a modified version of [So Simple][so-simple] by Michael Rose. The color scheme has been changed, featuring <span style="color:#DBAAA9;">**Pastel Pink**</span> and <span style="color:#746D71;">**Sonic Silver**</span>, as inspired by one of [my favorite mugs][mug]. The typography features a number of fonts available through Google Fonts under the [Open Fonts Licence][font-ofl]. The monospaced font used in pre-format text is [Anonymous Pro][font-mono], the sans-serif font used in the headers is [Oswald][font-sans], and the serif font used in the body text is [Markazi Text][font-serif].

Currently, this blog contains approximately {% for post in site.posts %}{{ page.content | number_of_words }}{% endfor %} words. Isn't that neat?
