I am Sabrael D. Carroll (she/her), better known as rabbitDumpling—the internet's favorite bunny girl—and this is my blog. Probably the hundredth iteration of me starting a blog, but we'll call this one rabbitDumpling(dot)net v1... for now. I am a queer content creator—writing RPGs, recording podcasts and streaming video games—who loves telling stories.

I built this site because, at the time of this entry, we are at the beginning of month seven of the Covid-19 timeline. In those seven months, I've let my creativity lapse. I've also started feeling guilty for not being productive. To keep sane, I've decided to get back to blogging. I also decided to tap into my inner teenage angst, back when I blogged about anything that came to mind. Sorry about that in advance. So what can you expect aside from my mental ramblings? I'm so glad you asked.

## rabbitDumpling(dot)net
Besides my general blogging, I'll also be making use of this space to share some more of my writing. Excerpts from fiction pieces I am working on, or have. I will be taking advantage of writing prompts and short story competitions. You can expect me to share my writing here. I do also write prose, usually related to some topics near and dear to me.

## Final Fantasy (in)Complete
I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rabbitdumpling) and am challenging myself. I plan to beat the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games. Currently, I am about 3/4 of the way into 6. I plan on writing up reviews and thoughts about all the games, you can find those [here](../ffc.md).

## Final Battle
Final Battle is one of my oldest and most expansive projects. It is both a universal RPG system as well as a multiverse setting. Imagine taking two different games and combining them. A magical gunslinger riding alongside a sorceress, helping an alien on his quest. Each feels unique but they remain compatible. A lot of complexities have come and gone with the various versions and drafts that I've written. Now it's time to put together a new edition.

There will be some other stuff of course but those are some of the starting topics you can expect. You can always check the [Projects](../projects.md) page for some of my major activities. So again, welcome to rabbitDumpling(dot)net and I hope you enjoy your stay.
