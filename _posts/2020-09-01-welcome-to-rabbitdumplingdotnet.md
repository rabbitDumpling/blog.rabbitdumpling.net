I am Sabrael D. Carroll (she/her), probably better known as rabbitDumpling—the internet's favorite bunny girl—and this is my blog. Probably the hundredth iteration of me starting a blog, but we'll call this one rabbitDumpling(dot)net v1... for now. I am a queer content creator—writing RPGs, recording podcasts, and streaming video games—who loves telling stories.

I built this site because at the time of this entry, we are at the beginning of month seven of the Covid-19 timeline. In those seven months, I've grown disinterested in maintaining my projects and simultaneously guilty for not being creatively productive. In an effort to retain sanity, I've decided to get back to blogging. I have also decided to tap into my inner angsty teenager, back when I blogged about just about anything that came to mind. Sorry about that in advance. So what can you expect aside from my mental ramblings? I'm so glad you asked.

## rabbitDumpling(dot)net
In addition to my general blogging, I'll also be making use of this space to share some more of my writing. Excerpts from fiction pieces I am working on, or have. I plan on taking part in some short story competitions, as well as testing my mettle in the arena of writing prompts. I do also occasionally write prose, usually related to some topic near and dear to me.

## Final Fantasy (in)Complete
I stream on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/rabbitdumpling)—recently just reached 1-year of being an Affiliate—and currently I am challenging myself beat the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games. Currently I am about 3/4 of the way into 6. Originally I had hopes that this challenge would be completed by the end of 2020, but I have decided to simply let it run its course as needed. The later games (the 3D generation specifically) have so much content that I don't want to rush through them if I don't need to. I plan on writing up reviews and thoughts about all the games, so expect those to be posted here as well.

## Final Battle
Final Battle is one of my oldest and most expansive projects. It is both a universal RPG system as well as a multiverse setting. Imagine taking two wildly different games and combining them easily. Magical gun-wielding cowboys riding alongside a dragon-riding sorceress, helping their cyborg samurai friend on his quest. Each feeling unique, and compatible. A lot of complexities have come and gone with the various versions and drafts that I've written. My hopes are to put together a new final edition.

There will be some other stuff of course but those are some of the starting topics you can expect. You can always check the [Projects](../projects.md) page for some of my major activities. So again, welcome to rabbitDumpling(dot)net and I hope you enjoy your stay.
