After rediscovering a fondness for RPGs I had forgotten, I have challenged myself to play and beat the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games. When a member of my audience jokingly asked if I was going to 100% finish them, I clarified these were going to be technically completeâ€”(in)Complete as it were.
