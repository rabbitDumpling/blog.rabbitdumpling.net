I own more than a few games, many of which are part of en extensive Steam collection. I use [The Backloggery](https://backloggery.com/) so organize that collection. And while I do stream quite a bit, I doubt I will be playing absolutely everything I own on stream. So while I get through my backlog of games offline, I plan on writing in-depth reviews for those games. I will conquer of the minions of Bak'laag!
