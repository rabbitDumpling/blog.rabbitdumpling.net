When I changed the format of my live stream to focus on RPGs, I thought I'd revisit some classics. The first challenge was to beat the first ten mainline Final Fantasy. When I announced this, someone in my audience asked if I was going to 100% finish each game, to which my answer was a resounding "No." Since starting this project, the scope has expanded to complete the entire run of mainline (non-MMO) games.
